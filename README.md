# Dendritic-Spine-Analysis-Dataset
A fully annotated dataset of Two-Photon Laser Scanning Microscopy (2PLSM) images of three types of dendritic spines. We make a standard dendritic analysis dataset publicly available including raw data, manual annotations (segmentations), and manual labels. Manual labels and annotation (segmentations) are provided by a neuroscience expert. The dataset has been used in [1] to perform dendritic spine analysis.
